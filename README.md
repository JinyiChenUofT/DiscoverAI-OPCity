Many large cities have a problem with traffic congestions.In this project, we aim to explore the possibility of dynamically assign the lane of the traffic to alleviate the congestions problem. 

## We are resolving this problem in two parts:
1. Machine Learning Model -- to estimate the vechicle volume 

2. Lane Assign Model  -- use the estimated volume to assign lanes
